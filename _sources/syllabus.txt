Course Objectives
=================

This course is a survey of predominantly European music in the nineteenth century. We will cover a breadth of composers (Chopin, Liszt, Schumann, Berlioz, Wagner, and Verdi, among others), genres (solo instrumental, art song, choral, instrumental chamber music, concerto, symphony, opera), nations and regions (France, Germany and Austria, Italy, Russia, North America), and topics (salon culture, virtuosity, folk music, orientalism, musical meaning, memorialization, etc.). Ability to read scores is required; Theory 1 (MUSI 3310) strongly recommended as a prerequisite. 

For music majors: This course fulfills either the first historical requirement or an elective requirement.

Enrollment deadlines: The last day in the College to add a course is Wednesday, February 1; the last day to drop a course is Thursday, February 2; the last day to withdraw from a course is Wednesday, March 14.

Student Evaluation
==================

Students will be evaluated on the basis of:

- Lesson exercises / class participation (30 pts)
- List generation project (20 pts)
- Experiment project (20 pts)
- Data Analysis project (30 pts)

for a total of 100 points.



Students with disabilities
==========================

This syllabus is available in alternative formats upon request. In
addition, if you may need an accommodation based on the impact of a
disability, you should contact the instructor immediately.  Students
with special needs should contact the Office of Disability Services
(ODS) at 292-3307 for certification if they have not already done
so. Upon such certification, the ODS and the instructor will make
every effort to accommodate special needs. However, to ensure that
evaluation of student performance in the course is conducted in a
manner that is fair to all students, special accommodations will not
be granted in the absence of ODS certification.
