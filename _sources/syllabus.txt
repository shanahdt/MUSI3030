Course Objectives
===================

This course surveys European music in the nineteenth century. 
We will cover a wide array of composers (Chopin, Liszt, Schumann, Berlioz, 
Wagner, and Verdi, among others), genres (solo instrumental, art song, choral, 
instrumental chamber music, symphony, opera), nations and regions (France, 
Germany and Austria, Italy, Russia, North America), and topics (salon culture, virtuosity, 
folk music, orientalism, musical meaning, etc.). 
|
We will be reading scores throughout the semester. Theory 1 (MUSI 3310) strongly recommended as a prerequisite. 
|
For music majors: This course fulfills either the 
first historical requirement or an elective requirement.
|
Enrollment deadlines: The last day in the College to add a course is Tuesday, 
September 10th; the last day to drop a course is Wednesday, September 11th; 
the last day to withdraw from a course is Tuesday, October 22nd.


Resources
===========

The following texts are required and are available either at the UVa Bookstore or through online sellers.

Required Text
----------------

Richard Taruskin, *Music in the Nineteenth Century* (Oxford, 2009; paperback, ISBN 0195384830)


Suggested Reading
-------------------

Carl Dahlhaus, *Nineteenth-Century Music* (University of California Press, 1991; paperback, ISBN 0520076443)

Piero Weiss and Richard Taruskin, *Music in the Western World* (Schirmer, 2007; paperback, 2nd edition, ISBN 053458599X)


Note that while I encourage building a library of such important 
musicological texts, these books can be quite expensive. I will work 
to put as much of these suggested readings on either this website or 
Collab, along with musical scores. For the listening assignments, I will 
direct you either to a streaming database to which the UVa library subscribes, 
or good quality recordings on YouTube. Links will also be 
made available on the course website. 

**NOTE:** If you have difficulty locating material for this course, please let me know immediately by email.


Website
==========

The course website can be found at
http://shanahdt.github.io/MUSI3030/. This site contains lectures, 
course materials, supplementary readings, quizzes and 
assignments **for self assessment**, and helpful links. 
It is intended to complement, rather than replace, Collab.


Assistance
============

I am available and interested in talking with you about the course,
the course material, and strategies to enhance your learning. 
We can usually have brief discussions after class, and I am able 
to answer questions by e-mail (dts9h@virginia.edu) at any time. 
Additionally, I am happy to set up an appointment at a time that 
is mutually acceptable for more lengthy discussions.

Attendance and Participation
=============================

You are expected to attend every class. After 2 absences 
I start to lower your grade. (I do not distinguish between 
excused and unexcused absences, except in extreme instances 
and supported by appropriate documentation.) Your participation 
grade is dependent upon your contribution to the class discussion. 
To earn maximum points for class discussion, try to contribute regularly and thoughtfully. 

Weekly Question Sheets
========================

There will be questions on the readings due every Tuesday. 
Answer these questions as succinctly as possible--usually one or 
two words per answer will suffice. Please submit these in **hard copy, pledged** 
(See *Honor* section below).

Biweekly Listening Comparisons
================================

Every other Thursday you will be asked to write 1-2 pages 
(about 500 words, double-spaced in 12-point font, with page numbers) 
in which you compare two or three similar pieces assigned for that day. 
I will provide an example of such a comparison as a model for your own essays. 
Please submit these in hard copy, pledged. Since this assignment is biweekly, 
the class will be divided into two halves--Groups A (even weeks) 
and B (odd weeks)--and you will submit your assignment according to your 
grouping. Since the odd weeks outnumber the even weeks by 
one on our schedule, the members of the odd-week group 
(Group B) do not have to submit a comparison for one week of their choice. 

Quizzes
=========

Quiz 1
----------
Placed at about a third of the way through the course, 
Quiz 1 will comprise mainly short-answer questions selected 
from the Question Sheets and listening identifications from the 
assigned listenings. This Quiz will be administered during class.

Quiz 2
----------
This Quiz will have the same design as Quiz 1, but 
it will occur at about two thirds of the way through the course.

In-Class Presentation
====================== 

You’ll pair up with another student to orally present your 
Listening Comparison on a Thursday during the semester. 
Since you'll be presenting together, you may submit either 
one written comparison for the two of you or two separate comparisons. 
We will be assigning days to presenters on the second day of class 
(Thursday, August 29th), so if you have a preference for either 
a partner or a particular day or both, please come to class 
with your preferences in mind. I cannot guarantee that you 
will get your first choice, but you should feel assured that 
all the listening assignments are equally good. Please 
include audio-visual elements in your presentation: listening 
excerpts, handouts, slideshow, etc. When listening to 
presentations by other students, be respectful 
and attentive, take notes, and be prepared to ask 
follow-up questions. I am expecting that those who belong 
to the same Comparison Group will be especially lively 
contributors to discussion, since they'll just have 
completed the same exercise.


Final Paper
============= 

Your final, 8- to 10-page paper will be due at 5pm on Monday, December, 9th. 
I will meet with each of you individually during the week of Monday, November 11th, 
to discuss possible paper topics. Sign-up will be on Collab the previous week. 
Please come to our session with at least two possibilities in mind. You are 
also required to submit a 1-page, single-spaced outline and a 1-page, 
single-spaced bibliography by the beginning of class on November 21st. 
I expect to find at least 6 distinct and substantial sources in your 
bibliography. (A wikipedia article is not a substantial source, nor is a blog.) 
Be succinct in your outline and judicious in your choice of sources 
for your bibliography. Since research methods and materials are specific 
to the topic you choose, we will strategize about them 
during our individual meetings in early November.

Recommendation for Listening 
==============================
Try to listen more than once to a piece. Do not let yourself be 
distracted while doing so. If you listen on a computer, try to 
use good quality headphones, rather than using flimsy ear 
buds or just letting the music play through your computer 
speakers. I also recommend always following along with 
either a score or a libretto (when applicable).

Policy on Late Assignments
============================ 

Since we will be discussing the answers immediately in 
class, Question Sheets and Biweekly Comparisons will not 
be accepted for a grade if they are submitted after the 
beginning of the class in which they're due. For the final 
paper and its preparation (the outline and bibliography), 
the grade will be lowered one increment (for example, B+ to B) 
for every day they are late.
