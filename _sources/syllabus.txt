Course Objectives
===================

This course surveys predominantly European music in the nineteenth century. We will cover a breadth of composers (Chopin, Liszt, Schumann, Berlioz, Wagner, and Verdi, among others), genres (solo instrumental, art song, choral, instrumental chamber music, concerto, symphony, opera), nations and regions (France, Germany and Austria, Italy, Russia, North America), and topics (salon culture, virtuosity, folk music, orientalism, musical meaning, memorialization, etc.). Ability to read scores is required; Theory 1 (MUSI 3310) strongly recommended as a prerequisite. 

For music majors: This course fulfills either the first historical requirement or an elective requirement.

Enrollment deadlines: The last day in the College to add a course is Wednesday, February 1; the last day to drop a course is Thursday, February 2; the last day to withdraw from a course is Wednesday, March 14.


Resources
===========

The following texts are required and are available either at the UVa Bookstore or through online sellers.

Required Text
----------------

Richard Taruskin, *Music in the Nineteenth Century* (Oxford, 2009; paperback, ISBN 0195384830)


Suggested Reading
-------------------

Carl Dahlhaus, *Nineteenth-Century Music* (University of California Press, 1991; paperback, ISBN 0520076443)

Piero Weiss and Richard Taruskin, *Music in the Western World* (Schirmer, 2007; paperback, 2nd edition, ISBN 053458599X)


Note that while I encourage building a library of such important musicological texts, these books can be quite expensive. I will work to put as much of these suggested readings on either this website or Collab, along with musical scores. For the listening assignments, I will direct you either to a streaming database to which the UVa library subscribes, or good quality recordings on YouTube. Links will also be made available on the course website. 

**NOTE:** If you have difficulty locating material for this course, please let me know immediately by email.


Website
==========

The course website can be found at
http://shanahdt.github.io/MUSI3030/. This site contains lectures, course materials, supplementary readings, quizzes and assignments **for self assessment**, and helpful links. It is intended to complement, rather than replace, Collab.


Assistance
============

I am available and interested in talking with you about the course,
the course material, and strategies to enhance your learning. We can usually have brief discussions after class, and I am able to answer questions by e-mail (dts9h@virginia.edu) at any time. Additionally, I am happy to set up an
appointment at a time that is mutually acceptable for more lengthy
discussions.

Attendance and Participation
=============================

You are expected to attend every class. After 2 absences I start to lower your grade. (I do not distinguish between excused and unexcused absences, except in extreme instances and supported by appropriate documentation.) Your participation grade is dependent upon your contribution to the class discussion. To earn maximum points for class discussion, try to contribute regularly and thoughtfully. 

Weekly Question Sheets
========================

There will be questions on the readings due every Tuesday. Answer these questions as succinctly as possible--usually one or two words per answer will suffice. Please submit these in **hard copy, pledged.** 

Biweekly Listening Comparisons
================================

Every other Thursday you will be asked to write 1-2 pages (about 500 words, double-spaced in 12-point font, with page numbers) in which you compare two or three similar pieces assigned for that day. I will provide an example of such a comparison as a model for your own essays. Please submit these in hard copy, pledged. Since this assignment is biweekly, the class will be divided into two halves--Groups A (even weeks) and B (odd weeks)--and you will submit your assignment according to your grouping. Since the odd weeks outnumber the even weeks by one on our schedule, the members of the odd-week group (Group B) do not have to submit a comparison for one week of their choice. 

Quizzes
=========

Quiz 1
----------
Placed at about a third of the way through the course, Quiz 1 will comprise mainly short-answer questions selected from the Question Sheets and listening identifications from the assigned listenings. This Quiz will be administered during class.

Quiz 2
----------
This Quiz will have the same design as Quiz 1, but it will occur at about two thirds of the way through the course.

In-Class Presentation
====================== 

Youâ€™ll pair up with another student to orally present your Listening Comparison on a Thursday during the semester. Since you'll be presenting together, you may submit either one written comparison for the two of you or two separate comparisons. We will be assigning days to presenters on the second day of class (Tuesday, January 24), so if you have a preference for either a partner or a particular day or both, please come to class with your preferences in mind. I cannot guarantee that you will get your first choice, but you should feel assured that all the listening assignments are equally good. Please include audio-visual elements in your presentation: listening excerpts, handouts, slideshow, etc. When listening to presentations by other students, be respectful and attentive, take notes, and be prepared to ask follow-up questions. I am expecting that those who belong to the same Comparison Group will be especially lively contributors to discussion, since they'll just have completed the same exercise.


Final Paper
============= 

Your final, 8- to 10-page paper will be due at 5pm on Monday, May 7. I will meet with each of you individually during the week of Monday, April 2, to discuss possible paper topics. Sign-up will be on Collab the previous week. Please come to our session with at least two possibilities in mind. You are also required to submit a 1-page, single-spaced outline and a 1-page, single-spaced bibliography by the beginning of class on Tuesday, April 17. I expect to find at least 6 distinct and substantial sources in your bibliography. (A wikipedia article is not a substantial source, nor is a blog.) Be succinct in your outline and judicious in your choice of sources for your bibliography. Since research methods and materials are specific to the topic you choose, we will strategize about them during our individual meetings in early April.

Recommendation for Listening 
==============================
Try to listen more than once to a piece. Do not let yourself be distracted while doing so. If you listen on a computer, try to use good quality headphones, rather than using flimsy ear buds or just letting the music play through your computer speakers. I also recommend always following along with either a score or a libretto (when applicable).

Policy on Late Assignments
============================ 

Since we will be discussing the answers immediately in class, Question Sheets and Biweekly Comparisons will not be accepted for a grade if they are submitted after the beginning of the class in which they're due. For the final paper and its preparation (the outline and bibliography), the grade will be lowered one increment (for example, B+ to B) for every day they are late.
