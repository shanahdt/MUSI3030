Dahlhaus on the "Twin Styles"
-------------------------------

Here is the Dahlhaus quote I alluded to in class on 8/29. It's in the intro of *Nineteenth-Century Music* I had forgotten that it was in reference to our 
old friend R.G. Kiesewetter. He writes:

        Raphael Georg Kiesewtter, a connoisseur of early music whom one 
        could scarcely accuse of being brainlessly susceptible to the "Rossini
        craze," referred in his *Geshichte der europaisch-abendlandischen oder 
        unserer heutigen Musik* of 1834 to his own age as the "era of Beethoven and Rossini."
        As jarring as this combination may at first seem, we could find worse criteria
        for judging any music history that attempts to reconstruct the past 
        in its own terms than to see whether it was able to find a vantage point 
        that illuminates the resonse for Kiesewetter's claim. (p.8)

The rest of this section entitled "Twin Styles" is worth a read, as it really 
relates quite nicely to our discussion.
