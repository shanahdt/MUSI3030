Philosophies of Music History and Style Change
==================================================
￼
￼Many approaches to constructing a narrative
• The “Great Man” Theory
• Evolutionary Approach
• Gradual vs. Rapid Style Change • Arcs of Typicality
￼
￼The “Great-Man” Theory
• In previous centuries, music histories fell into one of two camps: • The “dictionary” approach
• The “divine origin” theory of music
• In the 19th century, the divine-origin story survived, only now as an explanation of the origins of genius.
• G. Biani writes in 1828 of Palestrina’s “god-given genius”.
• Historiographer Warren Allen (writes that these “were not figures of speech, but ‘historical fact.’” (1939/1962, p.87)
￼
￼The “Great-Man” Theory
• In the nineteenth century, the history of music was increasingly written in terms of “the great names.”
• Warren writes that these were “the leaders in musical thought upon whom the gods or the muse had smiled at birth.”
• “Do you fancy I am thinking of your puking little fiddle when the muse confides in me?” -Beethoven (allegedly)
• R.G Kiesewetter writes “genius alone is absolute; everything else is relative, impermanent, unessential” (1848, p.246)
• Much of this was fueled by the rise of the Taruskin reading (“The First Romantics”).
￼￼￼￼￼This was a reactionary response to the histories using what Kiesewetter thought were arbitrary date demarcations
“Beethoven myth” discussed in the

￼Evolutionary Approaches
• Herbert Spencer (1850) writes that “advancement is due to the working of a universal law.”
• Spencer’s laws of progress and evolution was appealing to music historians.
• It allowed them to move beyond chronicling men and events, but to speak of music as an evolving organism which is “creating itself, developing itself and changing itself by virtue of various principles which are unfolded, each in its turn.” (Spencer, 1852 p. 145)
￼
￼Evolutionary Approaches
• Problems:
• A return to “primitivism”:
• “The progress of this somewhat immature period shows the inevitable tendency of all things from homogeneity towards diversity and definiteness.” (Parry, The Evolution of Art Music, 1893, p.169)
• Highly susceptible to ethnocentrism.
￼
￼Arcs of Typicality
• Gjerdingen (1989, 2007) suggests that musical gestures experience an arc, in which:
• Certain melodies, harmonies etc. gradually become more popular (and more typical) over time, and then begin to disperse and fracture over time.
• A bebop jazz lick may have started as a kernel, but as it was imitated more and more, it became more uniform. As players (and listeners) became comfortable with it, they deviated from the norm, creating new licks.
￼
￼Gradual vs. Rapid Change
• Best explained through linguistics:
• Gradual change occurs slowly over time. Like phonemes in languages or dialects, they slowly mutate, and shift intrinsically.
• Rapid change is facilitated by an external event. Shakespeare coining the word “assassinate.” The creation of Esperanto, or the written Cherokee language.

￼￼Now I say this to you not to explain that one approach is better than another, there is most certainly no right answer. But I do hope to inform how you experience this history class. We will kind of be going chronologically, although not entirely.

￼￼The Dahlhaus book is divided by arbitrary years, the Taruskin book goes in order, but scatters around to the topics. My hope is that you experience the interplay of musical ideas, the role of culture on musical change, and avoid the pitfalls of calling things “The Beethoven Era” etc.
