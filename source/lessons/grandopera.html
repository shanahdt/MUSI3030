Defining Grand Opera    </h1>
</hgroup>
<p>&quot;A grand opéra is a nineteenth-century French type...[containing] a
serious, often tragic subject of an epic or historical nature,
the use of the chorus in action, the inclusion of a ballet, at
least one spectacular scene with elaborate writing for the solo
and choral voices in concert and (normally) division into five acts...&quot;</p>

<p>To merit the name <em>grand opéra</em>, you had to concoct something large-scale, serious, French,
and almost always in five acts.</p>
<p>History of a monumental brand furnished plot material, often the history of religious conflict: Jews or Muslims
against Christians perhaps, or Protestants against Catholics.</p>

<p>While tragic opera often involved clashing tribes of some kind, librettists writing for the Opéra
defined those tribes as whole nations or faiths, not just Montagues and Capulets.</p>

<p>Charlemagne (or some other grand historical personage) broods

what could be more fitting than the sudden appearance of
a troupe of ballerinas, impersonating

it has a greater quantity of thunder and lightning, of
pasteboard seas, of paper snow storms, and dragons that spit
fire; also a gorgeousness of wardrobe and scenery not equalled
upon any theatre of Europe. It is certain its
'corps de ballet' can outdance all the world put together.

<p>&quot;The obligatory third-act ballet is a counterpart to Weber's Wolf's Glen scene, the fiery 'Valse infernale' representing
a demonic orgy in a deserted cave; most spectacularly, as well as most obviously indebted to the phantasmagoria shows,
it includes a swirling dance for a whole convent-cemetery's worth of risen nuns' corpses. With its
dancing dead nuns this was clearly just as much an opera to see as to hear...made Meyerbeer the toast of Paris.&quot;</p>

A Taxonomy of Love Triangles    </h1>
</hgroup>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Scott Balthazar (1995) presents a number of types of love triangles that take place in nineteenth-century opera.</li>
</ul>
  </section>

<section>
<hgroup>
    <h1>
Love Triangle Type 1    </h1>
</hgroup>
<p>Type 1: ‘false triangles’: the lovers feel helplessness,
confusion and misery; this is the earlier, eighteenth-century pattern of opera seria. No infidelity occurs,
for the lovers ‘realise that their problems originate elsewhere’,
for example through social rank. (Balthazar, 1995, cited in <em>Cambridge Companion
to Grand Opera</em>)</p>
  </section>

<section>
<hgroup>
    <h1>
Love Triangle Type 2    </h1>
</hgroup>
<p>Type 2: ‘misconstrued triangles’: again,
no infidelity occurs, this time because ‘the subject of the rivalry is blameless,
having ended previous affairs, or been forced
into an unwanted betrothal’, but at the same time
‘exonerating information is absent or ignored and
infidelity is presumed’; ‘a misconstrued love-triangle
multiplies and intensifies conflicts...increasing the
justification for a tragic ending’ but also allowing reconciliation.
(Balthazar, 1995, cited in <em>Cambridge Companion
to Grand Opera</em>)</p>
  </section>

<section>
<hgroup>
    <h1>
Love Triangle Type 3    </h1>
</hgroup>
<p>Type 3: the ‘true triangle’: in which, by an unwanted tie
of alternative marriage or  some other loyalty,
the main lovers are  ‘irrevocably estranged’ making reconciliation or
happiness ‘impossible’. Think of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>,
so admired in 1827 Paris, as well as <em>Le Siège de Corinthe</em>
or, later, Verdi’s <em>Don Carlos</em>. Grand opera prefers this
level of personal conflict, sometimes writ large against
opposing social or religious movements.</p>
